SwiftERM intelligent eMail remarketing for wordpress. Requires WooCommerce.

== Description ==

SwiftERM email remarketing for ecommerce, personalises emails using each of your consumer’s browsing, purchase and abandon data.

 Swifterm is different to email service providers. ESPs send bulk-emails to people en-mass. Each of them profess to have perfected the degree of analysis and segmenting for you. But the bottom line is they still group people together. This allows opportunity for error and inaccuracy. We don’t do that. We treat each consumer as an individual. We devize emails with the highest accuracy of product content, populate a stylesheet and send, one email at a time via the retailers own email server. Each one is unique to the recipient. We deliver that nirvana of customer-relations excellense – that each are personal and private. Years of work marketing for retailers, big and small, taught us that no two consumers are ever alike. Add into that mix, people’s taste and demands change perpetually.

As a consummate retailer you can purchase products that secure good margin, and you know your customer’s core demands. You buy products for them which are highly profitable. It is the degree of that skill that empowers you in today’s retail environment. We help take that core ability forward, using every nuance and subtlety from key position indicators on your website for each visitor. We watch what they hesitate on, keep coming back to, have affinity with, mix and match, adopt a style, grow loyalty towards, including brand, price-point and incentive etc. We perpetually calculate how to maximize the product selection for each individual, so when they receive an email from you, it contains all the items they most want to see, and are most likely to buy. In addition remarketing involves abandons, so when they put something in your shopping cart and don’t purchase we trigger an email to recapture over 60% of these lost sales.

All new registrations come with a free 30 day no obligation trial. No installation fees and no admin charges.

Plugin requires WooCommerce 2.5 onwards.
